# Canny-Edge-Detector
Multi-stage edge detection algorithm for PGM formatted image files. Involves:

Gaussian function calculation, non-maxima suppression of magnitudes perpendicular to the angle of the gradient, automatic HI and LO pixel value generation, and hysteresis thresholding calculation of the HI and LO pixel values

Takes sigma and percent values as user-inputted parameters.
